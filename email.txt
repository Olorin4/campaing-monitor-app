Hello NICK,

It was great meeting with you. Following our discussion, we would like to invite you to the next phase of our selection process. Please find below the exercise we need you to implement in order for us to understand your technical level. You need to deliver this to us by Sunday end of the day.

We will evaluate your deliverable based on:
UI
Ajax
Ease of use
Code structure (readability, software engineering principles, design patterns, Inversion of Control, OOP, etc)

We will also take into account:
Documentation and implementation instructions
If you have deployed this to a server
Form validation
Time

Please come back to me if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Margera
